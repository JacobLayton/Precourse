Lesson 7 Feynman writing prompts

Objects - in Javascript - objects are containers for "named values", also known as name:value pairs. They are
similar to arrays, as they contain a collection of data, but differ in that they hold alot of information about 
one thing. It is also organized differently, in that any value inside of an object is associated with a key
or property.

Properties - each name:value pair in an object is called a property, which consists of a key and its associated
value.

Methods - in addition to properties, objects may also contain methods. Methods are actions that can be performed
on objects. Methods are stored in properties as functions. They allow you to manipulate date inside or being 
passed to/from the object.

For in loop - a for in loop is similar to the for loop which we learned for arrays, however this loops through
the properties of an object. The block of code inside the loop will be executed once for each property.

Dot notation vs. bracket notation - Both dot and bracket notation accomplish the same thing, however bracket
notation is used when dealing with a variable, while dot notation is used when we explicitly know the name
of the property or key.
