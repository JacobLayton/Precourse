Lesson 5 Feynman writing prompts:

'for'- For loops can execute a block of code a number of times, which is handy if you want to run the
same code over and over again, each time with a different value. This helps avoid writing repetitive code

&& - Represent the logic operator AND. This returns true only if both expressions are true, and will
return false if one or both expressions are false.

|| - Represents the logic operator OR. This returns true if one or both expressions are true, and will 
return false only if both expressions are false.

! - Represents the logic operator NOT. This returns the opposite boolean value (true/false) of what is
passed to it.
