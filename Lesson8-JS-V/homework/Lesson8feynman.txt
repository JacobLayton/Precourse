Lesson 8 Feynman Writing Prompts

Prototype - All javascript objects inherit propeties and methods from a prototype.  Javascript is often 
described as a prototype-based language - each object has a prototype object, which acts as a template 
object which it inherits methods and properties from. The Javascript prototype property allows you to add
new methods and properties to object constructors. A link is made between the object instance and its 
prototype, and the properties and methods are found by walking up the chain of prototypes.

Constructors - Using an object constructor function creates a "blueprint" for creating many objects of
the same "type". There are two types of constructors: native (aka built-in) and custom constructors which
define properties and methods for your own type of object. Constructors can be differentiated from regular
funcions by their capitolized name and the use of the "new" keyword to call it.
