Lesson 9 Feynman

Callback functions - callbacks give you the ability to pass a function as an argument to another function.
more specifically, a callback is an object which can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to 
functions, created within functions, and returned from functions. Due to the fact that javascript is
an event driven language, callbacks are a good tool to ensure certain code doesnt execute until other
code has already finished.
