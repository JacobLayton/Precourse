Lesson 6 Feynman Writing Prompts-

Arrays - Arrays are like "storage conatiners' for collections of data known as elements. Elements in
an array can be strings, numbers, boolean values and even other arrays. An array does not have to contain 
all the same type of elements and the elements within an array are not fixed. Arrays have methods which 
allow us to mutate and modify the elements within them. This allows us to manipulate the data.
